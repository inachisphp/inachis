Forgot your password?

It happens! Someone from the IP {{ ipAddress }} requested that your password for "{{ settings.siteTitle|default(settings.domain) }}" is reset. If this was not you, then you can ignore this email - nothing will have changed. If this was you, please use the URL below to reset your password.

Reset your password: {{ settings.domain ~ url }}

For security purposes, this link will expire on {{ expiresAt }}, or as soon as you change your password.
